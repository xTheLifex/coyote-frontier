/// HEY YOU WANT TO ADD A NEW EVENT RESPONSE CONDITION?
/// JUST MAKE A NEW COMPONENT THAT INHERITS FROM THIS ONE

/// THEN IN THE SYSTEM, ADD A SUBSCRIBELOCALEVENT FOR YOUR COMPONENT
/// AND CALL THE RESPONDTOEVENT METHOD WITH YOUR COMPONENT TYPE
/// AND IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY HANDLE THE RESPONSES FOR YOU
///
/// JUST COPYPASTE THE RESPONDTOEVENT METHOD
/// AND CHANGE THE COMPONENT TYPE TO YOURS
/// AND IT WILL WORK
